//! Episode terminal settlement core — the crate-internal realization of
//! the D11 designated semantic authority (ADR-PBK-002 §17) and the D14.3
//! authority-owned settlement shape. It is NOT the application seam: the
//! application-facing episode surface is [`crate::handle::
//! PlaybackSessionHandle`] (F2 reality-gate-2 verdict B); this type stays
//! an internal replaceable realization behind it.
//!
//! Settlement ownership (D11 / D14.3):
//!
//! ```text
//! mechanism evidence producers (worker wrapper, render leg via
//! DrainSignal, stop intent, activation diagnostics)
//!     publish evidence only
//!         ↓  every publication path runs the session-owned settlement
//!            step synchronously, under the one completion lock
//! Playback Session-owned settlement (resolve + commit exactly once)
//!         ↓
//! observe / wait_terminal consume the committed Fact only
//! ```
//!
//! Three publication sites can complete the decisive evidence set, and
//! all three settle on the publishing leg's own call stack:
//!
//! ```text
//! decode failure evidence   → settle inside decode_failed
//! worker terminal evidence  → settle inside worker_exited
//! drain verdict             → the session installs a one-shot observer
//!                             on its DrainSignal at construction, so
//!                             the first successful complete() publishes
//!                             and settles synchronously on the render
//!                             leg's call stack, before complete returns
//! ```
//!
//! There is no settlement watcher, resolver thread, or asynchronous gap
//! (D14.3 forbids a resolver thread outright). `request_stop` records
//! intent through the same completion lock, so the lock IS the decision
//! boundary: a stop linearized before the decisive publication
//! participates in the classification; a stop linearized after it cannot
//! relabel the already-committed outcome (D11 late-command rule).
//!
//! Neither `observe_snapshot` nor `wait_terminal` resolves: a consumer
//! call can never create the terminal Fact, and no consumer call is
//! required for it to appear ("worker evidence last" and "drain verdict
//! last" both commit autonomously — pinned by the M4/W4 witnesses).
//!
//! One core serves exactly one episode: activation binds one edge and
//! the outcome memoizes on first settlement, so do not re-use a
//! completion across a retried or restarted episode.
//!
//! Outcome precedence, stated once here: a published decode failure
//! dominates everything (it is checked first and is not relabelled by
//! stop intent); otherwise the drain verdict plus the worker's exit
//! terminal decide, with recorded stop intent disambiguating an aborted
//! drain between a user stop and a device failure.
